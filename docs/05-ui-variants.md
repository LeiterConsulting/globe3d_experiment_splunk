# UI Variants

This starter includes two interchangeable frontend variants:

- `rich-ui` (default): full demonstration panel set
- `minimal-ui`: small shell for rapid greenfield prototyping

## Commands

```bash
npm run variant:rich
npm run variant:minimal
```

Both commands replace `src/App.tsx` from `starter_variants/<variant>/src/App.tsx`.

## Typical workflow

1. Start with minimal UI for backend/route bring-up.
2. Confirm data path and capabilities in Splunk.
3. Expand into custom UX from that baseline.
